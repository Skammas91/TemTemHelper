Files for TemTem the game.
Hello guys. Today I was finaly able to play the game. I hope this helps at least one person. This should fix the problem of getting the eternal black screen after launching on Steam, without even seeing the "Press any key" screen. I suggest you download the files first and give it a try (B option):


[A] TL;DR (too long; didn't read ) VERSION:

-Go to C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Temtem ~Or whatever path you use for the Steam Folder.

-Right click the TemTem.exe -> Proprieties -> Compatibility

-Mark the options: Run as Administrator and Run this program in compatibility mode for: (Select Windows 7 here).

-Apply -> Ok.

-Open game and wait until it works. (took me about 15 minutes)


[B] IF it didn't work, or you are just lazy:

-Go into my Github: https://github.com/Skammas91/TemTemHelper

-Download the files.

-Paste them on your TemTem Settings folder (C:\Users\YouHere\AppData\LocalLow\Crema\Temtem) Replace if needed.

Even tho is a possible fix for a specific problem, maybe it could fix another crashes. I saw a lot of people with similar problems, black screens, crash after character creation, chash on second logging, crash after playing for some hours etc. So try it out and share results.

My game is on Steam.
My screen is 1920x1080
PC with 4 gb RAM.
Intel Core i3-2100 CPU at 3.10 Ghz
Windows 10
NVIDIA GeForce GT 730
